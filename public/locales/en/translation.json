    "description": "<br />I started as a test engineer for 4 years, using different types of testing such as <strong>Unit testing</strong> and <strong>End-to-End testing</strong>. These experiences helped me develop a keen eye for detail. <br /> After that, I got interested in front-end development. I learned about <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>, and in my first job as a front-end developer, I made over 20 pages for both mobile and desktop displays using Vue.js, SASS, BEM, and Bootstrap-Vue. <br /> Later, I worked with React, Axios, TypeScript, and Styled-Components on projects in Europe. <br />I worked with many team members and liked working together using <strong>Agile methods</strong> and <strong>Scrum</strong>. <br />I firmly believe that tools are important, but it's even more important to be excited about learning. That's what helps both companies and developers grow."
